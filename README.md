  - This shows that 56.666666666666664 % of paid reviews are 5 stars, and 56.72445948746287 % of unpaid reviews were 5 stars.

## Summary:

- There doesn't seem to any real bias between the paid reviews and the unpaid reviews.  Both are approximately 57 percent 5 stars. 
- I think we should do additional analysis on other catagories to see if the trend continues.
